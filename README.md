## Dataset

The data set used to conduct the explorationand analysis is "Prosper Loan Data." This data is about loans that were given by Prosper Bank. The dataset contained 81 features that give information about each loan applicant. There are 113937 applicants that have different information regarding their occupations and loan-related data. The dataset can be found in the "Dataset Options" Google Doc file provided by Udacity.

## Summary of Findings

I discovered a negative relationship between the borrower rate and the loan amount during my investigation.Surprisingly, the rate falls as the loan amount grows. However, the term of the month did not greatly affect the relationship between the two variables. Another interesting finding from the exploration is that there are a few applicants who did apply for loans to improve their homes, but they do not own homes, which might be the reason the loan was entered incorrectly or the applicant somehow did not provide the correct reason for their loans. Also, regarding the main feature of interest, the borrower rate was constant for all the loan terms (12, 36, and 60 months), which suggests that the rate does not affect the term of the loan. 

Aside from the main point of interest, there are a few other details about the loans and the applicants that are worth noting.
First, the majority of the applicants have only one loan with Prosper. Moreover, almost half of the applicants own their homes (50.4%). 
Second, about 60% of individuals who applied for loans are employed. On the other hand, less than 1% of those who applied for loans are 

Finally, it seems that the current, completed, and payment-issued loans have the same number of loans (only one loan).


## Key Insights for Presentation

In this presentation, I will look at the relationship between the borrower rate vs. the loan amount and the length of employment.I will show the main points and the result using a scatter plot. One of the important points that I want to show is the type of relationship between these variables and the main feature of interest (borrower rate).

In addition, I will present Employment Status and Owning a Home to talk about whether employment status is associated with home ownership. Then display the information using a count plot.

Finally, I will focus on the distribution of the loan term. I will briefly explain how many loans each term holds. The presentation will be done with a bar plot.
